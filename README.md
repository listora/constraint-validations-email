# constraint-validations-email

Adds support for validating emails to [constraint][]

## Installation

To install via Leiningen add the following dependency to your `project.clj`:

``` clj
[listora/constraint-validations-email "0.0.1"]
```

## Usage

``` clj
(require '[constraint.core :refer [valid?]]
         '[constraint.validations.email :refer [email]])

(valid? (email) "hello@example.com") ; => true
```

Validation is handled by [commons-validator][] internally. Support for
validation of local addresses will be made available as soon as we can [update
commons-logging][].
